            Banking institutions can experiment with bankruptcy as an option
            for market exit, although mergers and acquisitions will remain
            as the main option, said Xiao Yuanqi, chief risk officer and
            spokesman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory
            Commission (CBIRC), at a media briefing on Thursday. Speaking of
            the lower-than-expected operational performance of certain small
            and medium-sized financial institutions, he noted that although
            each institution has its own features, it has to abide by the
            law of market. “The banking and insurance regulator will try to
            avoid the exposure of high risk at newly established financial
            institutions based on a study of past experience and will lower
            the risk through multiple measures, including mergers and
            acquisitions,” he said.
